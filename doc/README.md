CARI Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[CARI Core](http://cri.eco/wallet) is the original CARI client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of CARI transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run CARI Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/cari-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/carid` (headless)

If this is the first time running PIVX Core (since v5.0.0), you'll need to install the sapling params by running the included `install-params.sh` script, which copies the two params files to `$HOME/.cari-params`

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run cari-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag CARI-Qt to your applications folder, and then run CARI-Qt.
